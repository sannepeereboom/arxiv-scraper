# arxiv-scraper
- When opening in Excel use the data import tool and set the custom delimiter to "@@@@@" - normal use of comma separator ends up splitting within abstracts
- Will need some manual work but the "clean" csv without the @-separator should theoretically be ASReview-compliant (only requires "title" and "abstract" column names)
- Includes possible journal references for papers that are now published and/or doi IF the authors provided them on arxiv
